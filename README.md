Old McDonaldâ€™s Farm
Guidance: implementation can be done in any language you're comfortable with. Please make sure to include tests.
Time: 20 minutes

Implement an object oriented version of Old McDonald's Farm. On his farm, Old McDonald has a Cow, Pig, and a Dog. Cows go "Moo", Pigs go "Oink", and Dogs go "Woof". Implement a Sing() method on the Farm object, which returns the following text:

Old MacDonald had a farm, Ee-i-ee-i-oh! And on that farm he had a Cow, Ee-i-ee-i-oh! With a Moo-Moo here,
And a Moo-Moo there
Here a Moo, there a Moo,
Everywhere a Moo-Moo
Old MacDonald had a farm, Ee-i-ee-i-oh! And on that farm he had a Dog, Ee-i-ee-i-oh! With a Woof-Woof here,
And a Woof-Woof there
Here a Woof, there a Woof,
Everywhere a Woof-Woof
Old MacDonald had a farm, Ee-i-ee-i-oh! And on that farm he had a Pig, Ee-i-ee-i-oh! With a Oink-Oink here,
And a Oink-Oink there
Here a Oink, there a Oink,
Everywhere a Oink-Oink

Old McDonald sold his farm to a French farmer named Vieux Maturin. Vieux Maturin brought along his own French Cows ("Vache"), Pigs ("Cochon"), and Dogs ("Chien"). French Cows go "Meuh", French Pigs go "Groin", and French Dogs go "Ouah". Implement the French version of the farm. The Sing() method should now return:

Vieux Maturin had a farm, Ee-I-ee-i-oh!
And on that farm he had a Vache, Ee-I-ee-i-oh! With a Meuh-Meuh here
And a Meuh-Meuh there
Here a Meuh, there a Meuh,
Everywhere a Meuh-Meuh
Vieux Maturin had a farm, Ee-I-ee-i-oh!
Vieux Maturin had a farm, Ee-I-ee-i-oh!
And on that farm he had a Chien, Ee-I-ee-i-oh!
With a Ouah-Ouah here
And a Ouah-Ouah there
Here a Ouah, there a Ouah,
Everywhere a Ouah-Ouah
Vieux Maturin had a farm, Ee-I-ee-i-oh!
Vieux Maturin had a farm, Ee-I-ee-i-oh!
And on that farm he had a Cochon, Ee-I-ee-i-oh! With a Groin-Groin here
And a Groin-Groin there
Here a Groin, there a Groin, Everywhere a Groin-Groin
Vieux Maturin had a farm, Ee-I-ee-i-oh!
